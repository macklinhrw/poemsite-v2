Don’t think\nThat I will ever lose you. Time is nothing.\nTheir petals ring like the fragile beat in my heart.\nDon’t think that you live through me; it is the opposite climb:\nI will meet you there as I do each moment of my life.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdVr4R550ro","isDraft":false,"hasTitle":true,"createdAt":"2021-12-20T08:34:45.729Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-20T08:34:45.729Z","__v":0}
