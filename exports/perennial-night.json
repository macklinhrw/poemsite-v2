Here I speak\nTheir language although it is not my own\nForever colored lights in the distance give me some hope though\nI am partially blind in the dark.\nCome find me. I am as close\nAs your fingers. My heart\nRhythms like yours\nEven as I am hidden\nI am easy to find\nI could be you\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1QtE_S7NdDw","isDraft":false,"hasTitle":true,"createdAt":"2021-12-20T08:46:28.538Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-20T08:46:28.538Z","__v":0}
